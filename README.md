# Superstore-Sales Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze Superstore sales data to uncover business insights using Python and visualize them through a professional Power BI dashboard. This project demonstrates data cleaning, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visual storytelling.

##  Dataset Information

- **Source:** Sample Superstore Dataset (CSV format).
- **Rows:** ~10,000 order records.
- **Columns include:**
  - Order Date, Sales, Profit, Quantity.
  - Region, Segment, Category, Sub-Category.
  - City, State, Ship Mode, Customer ID.

##  Data Cleaning Process

### 1. Initial Data Exploration:
- Checked dataset shape and structure using `.info()` and `.head()`.
- Identified columns useful for analysis.

### 2. Handling Missing Values:
- Checked for missing values using `.isnull().sum()`.
- No critical missing values were found in the key columns.

### 3. Duplicate Check:
- Verified duplicates using `.duplicated().sum()`.
- No duplicate rows found.

### 4. Data Type Conversion:
- Converted `Order Date` to datetime format.
- Verified numerical columns like `Sales`, `Profit` were floats.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### ðŸ”¹ Univariate Analysis:
- Sales distribution using descriptive stats and bar plots.
- Frequency of Ship Mode, Segment, Region, and Category.
- Identified top-selling Sub-Categories and standard ship mode was dominating.

### ðŸ”¹ Bivariate Analysis:
- Sales by Region, Segment, and Ship Mode.
- Sales by Category and Sub-Category.
- State and City wise sales performance.

##  Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard provides a high-level visual summary of sales data.

###  Key Visuals:
- Total and Average Sales KPIs
- Sales by Region, Segment, Category, and Ship Mode
- Map showing State-wise sales
- Detailed view of sales across sub-categories.

###  Highlights:
- **Consumer Segment** leads in sales
- **Phones** and **Chairs** are top-selling sub-categories
- **California** and **New York** are revenue leaders
- **Standard Class** is the most used shipping method
